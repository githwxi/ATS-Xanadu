Hi, there,

HX-2021-06-04:

Functional programming (FP) puts emphasis on "purity" these days.
In particular, it preaches all sorts of benefits gained from avoiding
updates in programming. This somewhat leaves one with the impression
that "pure" programs cannot have updates. How wrong! A novelty of ATS
precisely lies in that "pure" programs can have updates.

I am from the camp of FP. As a matter of fact, the core of ATS is
ML-like; it supports type inference, polymorphism, higher-order
functions, datatypes and pattern matching, etc. However, I also want
to stress that ATS offers much more than the usual kind of ML-like
functional programming, which, in my opinion, is far from being
adequate for systems programming (that is, implementing low-level
systems).

Once upon a time, we had LISP machines and operating systems written
in LISP.  I suppose that most people would call LISP a functional
language.  But LISP is not ML-like; it does not preach "purity" at
all. In particular, typical LISP programs make pervasive use of
updates. Maybe we should just refer to LISP as a functional imperative
programming (FIP) language.

What is so attractive about FIP? Let us first see a serious issue
with ML-like functional programming. With functional data structures
(that do not support modifications), it is often difficult, if
possible at all, to give an efficient tail-recursive implementation of
certain simple recursive functions. For instance, a famous example is
the following 'append' for concatenation two lists:

fun
append
(xs, ys) =
(
case xs of
| nil() => ys
| cons(x1, xs) => cons(x1, append(xs, ys))
)

Assume that the direct style of compilation is used to compile
'append'. Since 'append' is recursive but not tail-recursive, each
recursive call to 'append' requires allocating a new frame on the call
stack. This simply implies that calling 'append(xs, ys)' on a long
list 'xs' requires a deep stack for otherwise it causes the call stack
to overflow.

One possible attempt to implement 'append' in a tail-recursive manner
leads to the following terribly inefficient implementation:

fun
append
(xs, ys) =
rappend(reverse(xs), ys)
{
fun
reverse(xs) = rappend(xs, nil)
and
rappend
(xs, ys) =
(
case xs of
| nil() => ys
| cons(x1, xs) => rappend(xs, cons(x1, ys))
)
} (* end of [append] *)

Note that the implementation of 'rappend' is tail-recursive.  The
tail-recusive version of 'append(xs, ys)' traverses 'xs' once to
construct its reverse and then traverses the reverse to perform
reverse-appending; the constructed reverse of 'xs' becomes garbage at
the end.

While using non-tail-recursion is probably fine in the construction of
a compiler, it is not the case in systems programming, where it is not
uncommon to see the requirement that only tail-recursive functions
(that is, loops) be allowed.

ATS offers much more than the usual ML-like FP. It supports so-called
linearly typed FIP where (linear) data structures can be updated in a
type-safe manner. With it, one can write in ATS type-safe programs
that are very close to their counterparts in C in terms of both
functionalities and performances.  Also, ATS supports type-safe manual
memory management of C-style, obviating the need for a big run-time
memory management system if the programmer so chooses.
