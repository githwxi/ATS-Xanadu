# Building packages for ATS3
#
######

I have long been contemplating on building an ecosystem for ATS.

In the past, I did various experiments and, in particular, played
with an idea of using npm for distributing packages written in/for
ATS. And Ryan King even started to build a package management
system (PMS) for ATS (see https://github.com/RyanTKing/wombats for
more details). As always, you are welcome to share your ideas!

One thing seems rather clear to me is that any PMS for ATS should be
closely connected to the support for template resolution in ATS3. At
this stage, I have to stress that I am not yet clear as to how such a
connection can and should be made. Instead of forging something that
is yet to become more concrete, I plan to keep options open maximally
by simply using the github to distribute packages for now.

I created the following repo:

https://github.com/xanadu-lang/contrib

for hosting contributed packages. I put some of my packages there
for people to see. Mostly I intend to put links there to packages
stored elsewhere.

So far you can find the following packages:

https://github.com/xanadu-lang/contrib/tree/master/githwxi/StreamDemo
https://github.com/xanadu-lang/contrib/tree/master/githwxi/StreamDemo2

I suggest that a directory of the name TEST be included in a package;
this directory should contain at least one example that shows how the
package can actually be used. Of course, more documentation is better.

StreamDemo:

In the package StreamDemo, there are some functions for displaying
streams. Essentially, StreamDemo can turn a given stream into another
stream that allows the items in the given stream to be displayed in a
webpage. An an analogy, if we see a stream as a tape of some sort,
StreamDemo provides functions for building a machine to view such a
tape. StreamDemo is entirely template-based.

StreamDemo2:

In the package StreamDemo2, which builds on top of StreamDemo, there
is a webpage for viewing a stream; some contents of the webpage can be
specialized for any chosen stream. As StreamDemo2 needs to interact
with JavaScript (JS), it cannot be entirely template-based. Instead.
it contains a template portion (StreamDemo2.dats) and a non-template
portion (StreamDemo2_.dats); the latter provides functions that can
be called directly in JS.

I hope you find it interesting. Moreever, you can use these packages (or something
of your own) to build more packages for displaying streams and share them.
