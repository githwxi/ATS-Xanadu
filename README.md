## Licenses for ATS/Xanadu

* The Compiler (ATS/Xanadu):
  [GPLv3](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Xanadu/blob/master/COPYING-gpl-3.0.txt)
* The ATS source for the Libraries (ATSLIB/{prelude,libats}):
  [LGPLv3](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Xanadu/blob/master/COPYING-lgpl-3.0.txt).
* As a special exception, any C code generated by the Compiler based on the Libraries
  source is not considered by default to be licensed under GPLv3/LGPLv3. If you use such
  C code together with other code to create an executable, then the C code by itself does
  not cause the executable to be covered by GPLv3/LGPLv3. However, there may be reasons
  unrelated to using ATS that can result in the executable being covered by GPLv3/LGPLv3.
* The contributed portion (ATS/Xanadu/contrib) is released under the MIT license.
* There is also a release under the MIT license for the C header files of the Libraries,
  which one can, for instance, freely insert into C code generated from ATS source code.
