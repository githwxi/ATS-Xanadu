What is ATS3?

There are many aspects in terms of what
ATS3 is.

1. Static debugging:
   Dependent types, Linear Types

2. Dynamic semantics:
   C + templates (of style of C++)

3. Extensive support for meta-programming

I have been teaching ATS2 at Boston University for about 5 years
The biggest problem I see is the VERY steep learning curve associated
with ATS2.  Very few students were able to ever overcome it to reach
the point where they could truly start enjoying the power of
(advanced) type-checking.

When I designed DML (the predecessor of ATS) nearly 20 years ago, I
employed a two-layered approach to type-checking: ML-like
type-checking first and dependent type-checking second. I abandoned
this approach in ATS. Instead, there is only dependent type-checking
in ATS1 and ATS2. In ATS3, I plan to follow DML's two-layered
approach. In particular, a program in ATS3 that passes ML-like
type-checking can be compiled and executed. So one can skip dependent
type-checking in ATS3 if one so chooses. In this way, the learning
curve is expected to be greatly leveled. But there is much more than
just leveling the learning curve.

ML-like types are algebraic (involving no explicit quantifiers). Such
types are so much friendlier than dependent types (which often involve
explicit quantifiers) for supporting type-based meta-programming. I
feel I have finally got a chance to properly address the template
selection problem that can cause so much annoyance in ATS2 (due to the
use of dependent types for template selection).

In short, ATS3 adds an extra layer to ATS2 for supporting ML-like
algebraic type-checking.  Type-based meta-programming in ATS3 solely
uses algebraic types (while ATS2 uses dependent types). ATS3 may be
initially compiled to ATS2 so as to get it going quickly.

One crucial lesson learned:
By default, template implementation should not be recursive!!!

Before I take a break, I would like to give you an update on the
implementation of ATS3.

To put things into some sort of perspective, let me first say a few
words on the motivation behind ATS3.

Advised by Prof. Frank Pfenning, I did my PhD thesis on PROGRAM
VERIFICATION during my years at CMU, designing and implementing DML
(Dependently Typed ML), a programming language that extends ML with a
restricted form of dependent types. These days such dependent types
are often referred to as DML-style dependent types in the literature
(in contrast to Martin-Lof's dependent types that were originally
invented for creating a type-theoretic foundation for Mathematics).
By the way, please note that DML is considered the predecessor of ATS.

As you can see, there are two words in PROGRAM VERIFICATION. One must
talk about program construction when talking about program
verification. Originally, the kind of programs I intended to verify
were supposedly written in an ML-like language. But it soon (even
before 2008) became very clear to me that such a language badly lacks
meta-programming support. And I immediately started to improvise. I
first added some support for templates into ATS1 and then strengthened
it in ATS2.  Unfortunately, the kind of support for templates in ATS2
was in direct conflict with the support for dependent types. The
original primary motivation for ATS3 was to eliminate this (crippling)
conflict.

Up to ATS2, I mostly did language implementation for the purpose of
experimenting with a variety of programming features. At this point, I
no longer feel that I have time and/or energy to continue
experimenting. Compared to ATS2, I re-designed the implementation of
ATS3 to make it much more modular so as to better support future
changes and additions. I intend for ATS3 to eventually become a language
of production quality.

ATS3 is implemented in ATS2. There are three big components planned
for ATS3: program construction (Part I), program compilation (Part 2),
and program verification (Part 3).

######

Part 1:

At this moment, I have nearly finished Part I.

This part covers type inference (involving only ML-style algebraic
types) and template resolution (this is, replacing template instances
with proper template-free code).  There is currently a rudimentary
interpreter available for interpreting programs constructed in ATS3. I
have also being implementing a template-based prelude library for
ATS3.

Part 2:

I will soon be starting to work on Part 2 after taking a break, hoping
to finish something that can be tested at the end of the Summer.

Part 3:

This part essentially does type-checking involving linear types and
dependent types. Hopefully, I will be able to get a running implementation
by the Spring next year.

######

Based on what I have experimented so far, I find the current support
for templates in ATS3 to be a game-changing programming feature that
can greatly increase one's programming productivity. I am a bit amazed
by it :) If you think that the templates in C++ are powerful, then you
will find that the templates in ATS3 are even more powerful in many
aspects. Actually, not only just more powerful but also a great deal
safer. Keep tuned.

Cheers!
