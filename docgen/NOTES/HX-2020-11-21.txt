Hi, there,

As of today, I am pleased to announce that ATS3 has reached a stage
where it can be realistically used in software construction. This is
achieved after slightly more than two and one-half years of continual
development by yours truly :)

# The current status
#
######

XATSOPT:

Xatsopt is a functioning compiler implemented in ATS2 for translating
ATS3 into a typed intermediate language of the name XATSCML, which is
both C-like and ML-like. It is planned for xatsopt to further
translate XATSCML into XATSCL0, a low-level C-like language. I now
primarily see xatsopt as a library (libxatsopt) for implementing tools
to support programming with ATS3.

XATS2JS:

Xats2js is a functioning compiler implemented in ATS2 for translating
XATSCML into JavaScript (or JS for short). It should be noted that
xats2js can compile tail-recursive calls into local jumps, effectively
supporting the common practice in functional programming of writing
loops as tail-recursive functions.

I will give detailed explanation elsewhere on using xats2js. Generally
speaking, one can now practice a form of co-programming with ATS3 and
JS. The JS code generated by xats2js from compiling ATS3 source can be
directly combined with other JS code.

# Future Development

Documenting XATSCML:

This has been assigned a high priority. It is hoped that other
people interested in ATS3 can start developing tools for ATS3 after
a minimal amount of documentation on XATSCML is made available.

Advanced type-checking:

While one can specify with linear types and dependent types in ATS3,
there is no type-checking for such advanced types in xatsopt. I plan
to concentrate on implementing support for such type-checking in the
next phase of ATS3 development.

# A little history of ATS3
#
######

Essentially, ATS3 refers to the third edition of ATS, and ATS/Xanadu
is currently the only implementation of ATS3. Note that the names ATS3
and ATS/Xanadu are often used interchangeably.

In the ATS family of languages, the first implementation is named
ATS/Proto (2004) and the language it implements is referred to as
ATS0.  Please note that the implementation of ATS/Proto is written in
OCaml. The next implementation is ATS/Geizella (2007), which is also
written in OCaml. And the language implemented by ATS/Geizella is
referred to as ATS1. ATS/Anairiats (2008) is an implementation of ATS1
in itself; the implementation is first compiled by ATS/Geizella and
then by itself, succeeding in so-called bootstrapping. The next
edition of ATS is ATS2, which is given an implementation of the name
ATS/Postiats (2013) written in ATS1.

ATS/Xanadu implements ATS3 and the implementation is written in ATS2.
While there is currently no plan to bootstrap ATS3 by implementing it
in itself, it is perceivable that ATS/Xanadu can be readily translated
into such an implementation due to the fact that the difference
between ATS2 and ATS3 in terms of both syntax and semantics is fairly
minor.
